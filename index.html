                    <p>Here I got selected into a team of 5 students to participate in a Erasmus+ program called "CommercialPolis". In this program I had the oportunity to visit multiple schools in Europe and meet students, teachers and methods used by others.</p>

                    <p>I've chosed to take the photography and video path, getting accepted in a Bachelor of Sound and Image. However was probably the area I was more keen on at the time, during the course I realised it wasn't what I wanted, resulting in me droping out.</p>
                    <p>Non the less the time I was there I learnedmany things regarding the audiovisual, and got some real expirience arround art, from conceding a project to preparing an exhabition. Those years were great not only to learn and absove all the information but to try new things aswell</p>

                    <p>After I decided I wanted to drop out of university I had something calling me back to web development and programing, my main reason to take the multimedia course in highschool, so I started searching and asking friends and came across Udemy.</p>
                    <p>It was sugested to me that I took the Fullstack Development course by Angela Yu so I started there, having bought a Java Masterclass by Tim Buchakala and a Spring Boot 4, Spring 7 and Hibernate course by Chad Darby in the same moment.</p>

                    <p>The path into the multimedia area started here. I started by learning the basics about photography, design and some 2D animation and it quickly evolved to video, web development, 3D modeling and animation and even some C# programing for the characters created in unity.</p>
                    <p>Here I got selected into a team of 5 students to participate in a Erasmus+ program called "CommercialPolis". In this program I had the oportunity to visit multiple schools in Europe and meet students, teachers and methods used by others.</p>
